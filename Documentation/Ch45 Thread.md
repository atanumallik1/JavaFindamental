* On a single Thread the sequesnce of specific actions are predictable. It is possible to tell B will happen after A
* On Different Thread the sequence of Actions are not predictable . It is not Possible to tell when will C occur in reference to A or B ; C might happen before B or even B
* Running multiple threads creates multiple situations;  so it is difficult to develop a multithreaded architecture
